# Covid Cases API

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with some AWS Services like Lambda and API Gateway. I would not recommend using this API for production.

# Demo

Demo of the API can be found [here](https://4j222wktag.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dev/covid).

# API Usage

```

  /* Get all cases per country */
  {url}
  
  /* Get cases by country name */
  {url}?country=Japan

```
